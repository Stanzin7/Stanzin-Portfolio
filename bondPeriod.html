                    <p>The community bonding period for GSoC 2020 extended from May 4, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Since the four-week long community bonding is now almost complete and the coding period (Phase - I) is on the verge of commencing, I'd like to share my experience working during the same through this blog.</p><br>
                    <div class="text">Reading Documentation</div>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community bonding period gave me an opportunity to go through the code base. This helped me in understanding all the functionality that has been implemented in the claro theme, particularly the <b><i>postCSS</i></b> tool of it. Since the modernization implementation had already begun in the previous year, I got an overview of what all changes had been made to the code base to remove IE11 support. I also read a lot of documentation regarding my project, including the <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(99, 99, 255); border: none; background: transparent; padding:0;margin:0" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3324398" target="_blank">Claro CSS with new Coding Standard</a>.</p>

                    <div class="text">Coding Shouldn't Stop</div>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important part of the community bonding period is to PLAN for the work to be done in the coding period and get to know your mentors. I had several conversations with my mentor, Aditya Bathani, where we used to discuss the goals and the expectations for the coding period and also got to know each other in a better way. We also talked about issues that I faced and discussed on ways of resolving them.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to spend 6 hours a week TOGETHER. I will code around the day & at the end of day, my mentor will give me some advice on what i did & what should be done. There are total 62 Stylesheets of CLARO mentioned <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(99, 99, 255); border: none; background: transparent; padding:0;margin:0" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VttEmwlYSr8DJJz3-HoLMUtAtwn0PShSRJFqBSxHsA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Among this, 22 tickets were already made. Primarily, my mentor & me decided to atleast cover up this issues before mid-evaluation </p>
