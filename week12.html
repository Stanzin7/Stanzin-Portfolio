                    <p>After a month-long community bonding period, the coding period finally commenced. I was really eager to start contributing to my project and I worked on a few tickets as per the discussions with my mentor. As the second week of the coding period for Google Summer of Code 2023 is about to end, I'd like to share my experience during the same.</p><br><hr><br>
                    <div class="text">Tickets Worked on during this Week</div>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting my hands dirty with Drupal Codebase I started working on following issues :
                        <ul style="padding-left: 3.5%;">
                            <li><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(99, 99, 255); border: none; background: transparent; padding:0;margin:0" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3294002" target="_blank">button.pcss.css</a> (Status : RTBC)</li>
                            <li><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(99, 99, 255); border: none; background: transparent; padding:0;margin:0" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3293998" target="_blank">container-inline.pcss.css</a> (Status : RTBC)</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p><br><hr><br>
                    <div class="text">Challenges faced !</div>
                    <p>With a lot of active development, come issues and solutions to them. I faced some minor issues while working on the tickets during this week, which I was able to resolve myself or with the help of my mentor. Some of the issues are here :
                        <ul style="padding-left: 3.5%;">
                            <li>I faced few difficulty while installing COMPOSER and its packages. However, they were very minor & i get solution to it using Google & Mentor. Below is the glimpse of error.</li>
                            <img src="./images/week1.error1.png" width="500px" height="150px" alt="">
                            <img src="./images/week1.error2.png" width="500px" height="150px" alt="">
                            <li>However the above error was very simple to solve. The main error found to me was that while makking patch, i was getting out of scope. Thus so many unwanted code was also getting patched. However then i learned to patch only those files which are related to issue & important for the issue.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p><br><hr><br>

                    </p><br>That's all I have for now. See you in next weeks!<br>
